# 🧠 Practice Exercises Repository

Welcome to my **Practice Exercises** repository! This space is dedicated to sharpening my programming skills through daily exercises and coding challenges across multiple languages.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- practice-exercise
    - Java
        - exercises
        - challenge
    - python
        - exercises
        - challenge

## 🔸 Folders Explained

### `Java/` and `Python/`
These are language-specific directories containing all practice work.

- **`exercises/`**: Contains small-scale practice problems focused on syntax, logic building, and core concepts.
- **`challenge/`**: Contains larger or more complex problems that often simulate real-world scenarios or coding assessments.

Each file or notebook inside the folders is self-contained and includes comments to explain the logic.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build consistency and muscle memory in both Java and Python.
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through practical repetition.
- Create a public log of my growth for future job applications and personal reference.

## ✅ How to Use

If you're following along:
- Browse the `exercises/` folder for small practice problems.
- Explore the `challenge/` folder for bigger problems that may span multiple concepts.
- New files will be added regularly as I progress through my studies.
